Write a program that asks the user for their email and password. If the
email and password match a predefined set of credentials, print "User
login successful." Otherwise, keep asking for the email and password
until the correct credentials are provided.
Write a program that asks the user for their email and password. You
are given a list of predefined user credentials (email and password
combinations). If the entered email and password match any of the
credentials in the list, print "User login successful." Otherwise, keep

Write a program that takes a list of student details as input, where
each student is represented by a map containing their name, marks,
section, and roll number. The program should determine the grade of
each student based on their average score (assuming maximum marks
for each subject is 100) and print the student's name along with their
grade.
